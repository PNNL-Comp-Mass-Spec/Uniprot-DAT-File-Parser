GBK files can be processed by the UniprotDATFileParser.exe app 
to extract a few of the columns, specifically:
Accession and Description

We have considered updating it to support additional columns, 
but this has never been implemented.

As an alternative, use the BioPython script in file ConvertGBK.py

For example:
	python ConvertGBK.py -i NC_000962.gbk -o NC_000962.fasta
